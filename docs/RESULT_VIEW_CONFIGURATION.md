/list/results/[id]      -> Individual result detail view
```

### **Database Queries**

- **Optimized joins** for single query data fetching
- **Role-based WHERE clauses** for security
- **Related data inclusion** for comprehensive information display

### **Error Handling**

- **404 for non-existent results**
- **403-like behavior** for unauthorized access (returns 404)

## Files Modified/Created

- **Created**: `src/app/(dashboard)/list/results/[id]/page.tsx` - Result detail page

This implementation provides a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly result viewing system that maintains consistency with the application's design patterns while providing appropriate access control based on user roles.
