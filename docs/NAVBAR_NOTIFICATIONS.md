# Navbar Notification System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds dynamic notification counts to the navbar for announcements and messages, with automatic "mark as read" functionality when users visit the respective pages.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Announcement Count
- Shows the count of announcements from the last 7 days
- Badge only appears when there are announcements to show
- Displays "99+" for counts greater than 99
- Purple badge color for announcements

### 2. Automatic "Mark as Read" Functionality
- **When user clicks announcement icon and visits `/list/announcements`:**
  - The page automatically marks all announcements as "read"
  - The notification count in the navbar immediately becomes 0
  - Uses localStorage to track the "last read" timestamp
  - Badge disappears from the navbar

### 3. Message System Placeholder
- Prepared for future message functionality
- Blue badge color for messages (when implemented)
- Currently returns 0 as Message model doesn't exist yet
- Will work the same way as announcements when implemented

### 4. User Information Display
- Shows dynamic user name from session
- Shows dynamic user role from session
- Falls back to "Loading..." while fetching

## How It Works

### Mark as Read Logic
1. **User clicks announcement icon** → navigates to `/list/announcements`
2. **NotificationReader component** automatically runs on page load
3. **localStorage stores timestamp** when announcements page was last visited
4. **Notification hook checks** if announcements are newer than last visit
5. **Badge disappears** if all current announcements are older than last visit
6. **Real-time updates** via custom events between components

### Technical Flow
```
User clicks icon → Navigate to page → NotificationReader runs → 
localStorage updated → Custom event fired → Navbar updates → Badge disappears
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `src/hooks/useNotifications.ts` - Enhanced hook with read status tracking
2. `src/app/api/notifications/route.ts` - API endpoint for fetching notification counts
3. `src/components/NotificationReader.tsx` - Component that marks notifications as read

### Modified Files:
1. `src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Updated to use dynamic data
2. `src/app/actions/actions.ts` - Added `getNotificationCounts()` function
3. `src/app/(dashboard)/list/announcements/page.tsx` - Added NotificationReader component

## Technical Details

### localStorage Keys
- `announcements_last_read` - Timestamp when announcements page was last visited
- `messages_last_read` - Timestamp when messages page was last visited (for future use)

### Custom Events
- `notificationsRead` - Fired when a notification type is marked as read
- Contains: `{ type: 'announcements'|'messages', timestamp: ISO string }`

### Performance Optimizations
- Uses localStorage for instant UI updates
- Custom events for real-time communication between components
- Automatic refresh every minute for new notifications
- Efficient notification counting (only last 7 days)

## Usage

The system now automatically:
1. **Shows notification counts** for recent announcements
2. **Hides badges immediately** when user visits the announcements page
3. **Persists read status** across browser sessions
4. **Updates in real-time** without page refresh
5. **Handles errors gracefully** with fallbacks

## User Experience

### Before Implementation:
- Static "2" badge always showing
- No way to dismiss notifications
- Hardcoded user information

### After Implementation:
- ✅ Dynamic count based on actual announcements
- ✅ Badge disappears when user visits announcements page
- ✅ Real user name and role displayed
- ✅ Immediate visual feedback when clicking icon
- ✅ Persists across browser sessions

## Future Enhancements

### Message System Implementation
When Message model is added to the schema:

1. **Add Message model:**
```prisma
model Message {
  id          String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  title       String
  content     String
  isRead      Boolean  @default(false)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  senderId    String   @db.ObjectId
  receiverId  String   @db.ObjectId
}
```

2. **Update notification count function**
3. **Create `/list/messages` page with NotificationReader**
4. **Add message icon to navbar** (currently hidden when count is 0)

### Advanced Features
- **Real-time notifications** using WebSockets
- **Different notification types** (urgent, normal, info)
- **Notification history page** with read/unread status
- **Push notifications** for critical announcements
- **Bulk mark as read** functionality
- **Notification preferences** per user

## Error Handling
- **Network errors:** Falls back to 0 counts, retries automatically
- **localStorage errors:** Gracefully handles when localStorage is unavailable
- **Invalid data:** Validates and sanitizes all stored timestamps
- **Component unmounting:** Properly cleans up event listeners
- **Browser compatibility:** Works across all modern browsers

## Testing the Feature

### To Test Announcement Notifications:
1. **Add new announcements** in the database (within last 7 days)
2. **Refresh the page** - should see number badge on announcement icon
3. **Click the announcement icon** - navigate to announcements page
4. **Check navbar** - badge should immediately disappear
5. **Navigate away and back** - badge should stay hidden
6. **Add more announcements** - badge should appear again with new count

### Browser DevTools:
- Check localStorage for `announcements_last_read` timestamp
- Monitor custom events in console: `addEventListener('notificationsRead', console.log)`
- Network tab: See API calls to `/api/notifications`
