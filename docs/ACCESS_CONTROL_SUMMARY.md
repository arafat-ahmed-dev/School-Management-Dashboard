## üîí Security Implementation Details

### **URL-Level Access Control:**

- Individual detail pages (`[id]` routes) implement session-based access control
- Automatic redirects for unauthorized access attempts
- Role-based routing in individual pages

### **Data-Level Access Control:**

- Database queries filtered by user role and ownership
- Students see only their own data
- Parents see only their children's data
- Teachers see broader data but with action restrictions
- Admins see everything with full permissions

### **UI-Level Access Control:**

- Actions columns hidden/shown based on role
- Form modals conditionally rendered
- Create buttons only visible to authorized roles
- Role-specific shortcuts and navigation

### **Key Access Control Files:**

- `/src/lib/access-control.ts` - Central access control utilities
- Individual page files implement role checks
- Session management through NextAuth
- Database-level filtering in Prisma queries

### **Access Control Patterns:**

1. **Authentication Check**: `session?.user` validation
2. **Role-Based Routing**: Redirect based on user role
3. **Data Ownership**: Filter queries by user relationships
4. **UI Conditional Rendering**: Show/hide based on permissions
5. **Action Restrictions**: Prevent unauthorized operations

This system ensures proper separation of concerns and data security across all user roles.
